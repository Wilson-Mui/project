# Structure
My project is trying to tell the story of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. This is a drug/medicine that is has been banned by the DEA since 1985, and is on the verge of being approved by the FDA for use in therapy.

The sketch of my original structure can be found here:

# Shorthand
In Shorthand I've begun to create the general narrative arc and sections for my project. It begins with
1. Introducing MDMDA and addressing the biases and prejudices
2. Interactive Timeline of the work MAPS has been doing for 30 years
3. Current state of research, and the results in pie charts and bar charts
4. Map of where phase III trials are currently running (where Phase II trials were)
5. Expanded Access - This treatment can be brough to Pittsburgh NOW, through FDA's "Expanded Access Protocol"
6. Why - We have a population here that needs it (Veterans)
7. Video clip of phase II participants
8. Information and email signup

# Media/Charts
The media I will be using will be a combination of Knightlab, datawrapper (perhaps highchart, and another mapping software - currently unhappy with datawrapper's map option).

For organizational purposes I am stationing my charts at this link:
[Interactive Charts](https://wilson-mui.github.io/project/)

These charts will be integrated into the Shorthand storyline

# Feedback
I sought user feedback for this project by starting with the questioning framework provided by Professor Goranson.

I gave users this template to give an idea of the UX (as this would be a better indicator of the final page than my current framework)
[BBC Story with Shorthand](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/made_up_to_look_beautiful_sent_out_to_die)

I provided the link to the [Interactive Charts](https://wilson-mui.github.io/project/)

## Then I asked these basic questions:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

## General take-aways
- Overall the idea and purpose is clear, but I need a more direct title/headline on the first page (I have since made an improvement, I think)
- I need to connect the story to Pittsburgh (or Pennslyvania) better, as this is will be my stakeholders
- The Timeline interactive chart is a bit confusing. The grey background (I will change this) is too bland, and the gap with Merck's synthesis of MDMA in 1915 may be unnecessary, and is far away from the bulk of the story, which begins in the early 80's
- Simple bar charts are good and effective, however, another viewer said they wanted to see a timeseries of veteran suicide, and perhaps I should show both, or favor the time-series over a state comparison.
- The map is not very helpful, there's very little info (put more info), and the aesthetics (namely the boxes around the city name) feel "bulky?" (my words, not theirs)
- Think of other stakeholders, not just veterans.

I have only recieved detailed feedback from 2 individuals at this point, but I will continue to solicit feedback as my page fully develops.
