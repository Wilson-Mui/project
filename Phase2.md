# Structure
My project is trying to tell the story of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. This is a drug/medicine that is has been banned by the DEA since 1985, and is on the verge of being approved by the FDA for use in therapy.

The sketch of my original structure can be found here:

# Shorthand
In Shorthand I've begun to create the general narrative arc and sections for my project. It begins with
1. Introducing MDMDA and addressing the biases and prejudices
2. Interactive Timeline of the work MAPS has been doing for 30 years
3. Current state of research, and the results in pie charts and bar charts
4. Map of where phase III trials are currently running (where Phase II trials were)
5. Expanded Access - This treatment can be brough to Pittsburgh NOW, through FDA's "Expanded Access Protocol"
6. Why - We have a population here that needs it (Veterans)
7. Video clip of phase II participants
8. Information and email signup

# Media/Charts
The media I will be using will be a combination of Knightlab, datawrapper (perhaps highchart, and another mapping software - currently unhappy with datawrapper's map option).

For organizational purposes I am stationing my charts at this link:
