My intended audience is somebody local to Pittsburgh because I want to inform people who can make change in this city. Namely people interested in supporting MDMA clinics in city. I think to get that successfully implemented in this city, advocates of this program must align with groups that resonate with this community. That includes the veterans community.

Not only is that a population that can benefit from this treatment, they are a powerful and often identified group in the region. Because of that I made a choice of some military imagery, namely to emphasize the veterans component to my narrative. I was conscientious about not making it solely about veterans however, which is why my last 'image-transition-slide' had non-miltary images to emphasize the treatment should be for everyone.

I made quite a bit of changes to my original design upon evaluation. I removed the map component all together because I didn't feel it was adding much to the story, nor was it useful for the audience living in Pittsburgh. I also compressed the veterans bar chart, along with some facts on an infographic. It made it a bit more information dense, but I think it works both aesthetically and informationally. I also added a call out to further emphasize Pennsylvania's rank in veteran suicides.

One of the things I learned in this course and this process was the amount of DIY tools out there for building very professional looking charts, infographics and visualizations. I think much like you-don't-know-what-you-don't-know, now I realize there are probably a tool for almost anything I want to do (to some limited extent) adn I can google it.

However, I also realized how difficult it is to create visualizations the way I want them without high-level mastery of one tool. I've built my toolbox, now I need to specialize in a couple. I think in the future I will focus on d3 and perhaps ggplot since that is available in both R and Python, and is open source.

Finding the right (free) images for your story is very challenging. I think that is one of my biggest pet peeves in design. I think a better open source photostock should be available in the world. But even with a large photo library, it is not easy to decide what image is appropriate for an abstract idea. Thinking of the correct image to search for can be a challenge.
